# Movie Recommender System

## Overview
This project implements a Movie Recommender System using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset of movies to provide recommendations based on user-selected titles. The system fetches movie posters and displays them alongside the recommended titles.

## Features
- **Movie Recommendations**: Users can select a movie from a dropdown, and the system will recommend similar movies.
- **Poster Fetching**: The application fetches and displays movie posters from an external API.
- **Interactive UI**: Built using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Requests
- Pickle
- The Movie Database (TMDb) API
